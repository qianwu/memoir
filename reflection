# The Weight of Education: A Memoir Extract

As I watch my fourth-grade son struggle with his homework, a familiar weight settles on my chest. It's a mixture of frustration, worry, and an overwhelming sense of responsibility. At nine years old, he still hasn't grasped why he should learn, approaching education with a passivity that mirrors my own childhood—a reflection I find unsettling.

I can't help but project my own regrets onto his young shoulders. At thirty-five, I'm acutely aware of the time I wasted in my youth, blind to the true value of education. Not just in academics, but in understanding what really matters: empathy, caring for others, and the pursuit of freedom. These realizations came late for me, and now, watching my son, I'm gripped by a growing anxiety. I'm determined that he won't undergo the same process of unlearning and relearning that I did.

Four months ago, life threw me a curveball. Laid off from my job, I found myself at a crossroads. Instead of succumbing to despair, I saw an opportunity. I decided to pursue a master's degree abroad, a chance to reshape our lives and break free from the educational environment I've grown to distrust. The subsequent months were a whirlwind of IELTS preparation and job interviews, my days stretched thin between personal ambition and parental duty.

Now, employed again but still in the country we call home, I find myself living a double life. By day, I'm a professional, by night, a student chasing a dream of education abroad. And always, always, I'm a parent. Evenings are a battleground of homework supervision and language lessons, each assignment a step on a path I'm not sure I believe in, but dare not abandon.

There are moments when the weight threatens to crush me. The fatigue of constantly pushing against the current—in work, in my studies, in my son's education—sometimes plunges me into depression. I'm a person of deep empathy, and recently, while reading "Educated" by Tara Westover, I found myself overwhelmed with fury at her family's neglect. It stirred a question that haunts me: How can people bring children into this world without a commitment to nurture and love them properly?

As I write this, I realize that my struggle is not unique. It's a reflection of a larger societal issue—an education system that often prioritizes conformity over curiosity, rote learning over critical thinking. My journey, from a passive student to an adult frantically trying to course-correct for both myself and my child, is perhaps a microcosm of a wider awakening.

Yet, in this struggle, I find purpose. Every flash of understanding in my son's eyes, every small victory in my own studies, fuels my determination. I'm not just working towards a degree or a move abroad; I'm fighting for a future where education nurtures the soul as much as it feeds the mind. It's exhausting, yes, but also exhilarating. Because in this daily battle, I'm not just teaching my son—I'm continuing to educate myself.
